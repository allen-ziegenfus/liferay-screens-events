# liferay-screens-events

This is a sample project with liferay screens and iOS. The idea was an experiment with moving parts of the Liferay Events App, a hybrid app written with Titanium Appcelerator, to Liferay Screens. 

So far the app connects to a liferay server and shows a list of events with the DDLListScreenlet. The DDLListScreenlet uses a specialized theme with a UITableViewCell to display a background image and the name and location of the event.
